<h3> Why the site was created</h3>
<p>
The only reason this site was created was for if you want to look up an Avenger, it will show you a short bio of that Avenger and a couple of cool facts. Made because the new movie has just came out and maybe you want to catch  up on the Avengers before you watch the movie.
